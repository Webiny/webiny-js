## Installation

Installation instructions can be found in the official [docs](https://docs.webiny.com).

## About

Webiny consists of two layers that work closely together.

### GraphQL API

API layer works as a collection of Lambda functions with Apollo Federation handling all the GraphQL-related stuff.

### Client layer (SPA)

Our client (SPA) layer is based on `create-react-app` v2 and Apollo Client. If you ever developed using those tools - you already know Webiny ðŸ™‚
As our UI library we are using Material Components, and a very promising project [RMWC](https://jamesmfriedman.github.io/rmwc/) to get going with Material faster.
You can see all the currently available components in our [storybook](https://storybook.webiny.com/).

We also provide a server-side render setup out of the box. It is also powered by Lambda.

## Admin app

We provide you with an administration app so you can kickstart your projects much faster and begin developing features for your clients right away.
The entire admin app is based on plugins and you can customize everything.
